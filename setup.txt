IMPORTANT: Installation commands depend on Operating System. Look online for any help on how to install/run these thigs.

1. Install GIT on your machine

2. Create a folder called "Soup"

3. Inside the folder, clone the repository found at "https://github.com/VLaD0S/Soup" using "git clone"

4. Install "pip" for python 3.5 or higher

5. Install "virtualenv" for pip

6. Create a virtual environment called "env" in the same folder with the "coder.py" file and the "requirements.txt" file

7. Activate the virtual environment. Command may be different on your operating system.

8. Once inside the virutal environment, run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

9. Now you can run the command "python coder.py" for the password :)

10. Deactivate the virtual environment once you're done.

11. HOMEWORK: Try to understand all these shenannigans. It's very good practice
